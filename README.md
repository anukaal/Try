Exploring North and East Sikkim with my office colleagues was an unforgettable adventure filled with breathtaking landscapes and thrilling experiences. Our journey began in North Sikkim, where we marveled at the pristine beauty of **Gurudongmar Lake**, its frozen expanse reflecting the towering peaks, and wandered through the vibrant **Yumthang Valley**, soaking in the colorful rhododendrons and relaxing in natural hot springs. Moving to East Sikkim, we were mesmerized by the glacial **Tsomgo Lake**, enjoyed an exhilarating yak ride, and felt the rush of standing at **Nathula Pass**, the Indo-China border at 14,140 feet. The crisp mountain air, serene monasteries, and warm-hearted locals added to the charm of the trip. From sipping chai in freezing temperatures to sharing endless laughter on winding mountain roads, this journey strengthened our bonds and left us with memories to cherish for a lifetime.
